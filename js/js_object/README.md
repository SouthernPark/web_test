# Object
Objects are collections of properties.  
Properties are a key-value pair  
We use key to access data, rather than index  

# creating object literal  
const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Liu',
    age: '22'
};

We can put any types as a value.  

All keys are converted to a string.  


# access the value  
persion['firstName']    
or  
person.firstName  

# array of objects or array inside object
